# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## 0.4.0

- Rewrite both README capability lists as outcome-oriented capability summaries while
  keeping harness-specific acquisition and accounting details in their dedicated sections.
- Keep the runtime and project versions consistent with release metadata, and correct the
  stale Claude Code stderr limitation.
- Add `--harness {opencode,claude-code}` to `doctor`, `scan`, and `report`, defaulting
  to `opencode`. Read Claude Code session transcripts directly from
  `AGENT_WORKLOG_HARNESSES__CLAUDE_CODE__PROJECTS_DIRECTORY` (default
  `~/.claude/projects`); `--harness claude-code` runs no external harness CLI, and
  `doctor` instead checks that the projects directory exists and is readable, plus
  `git --version`.
- Build the Claude Code usage table from token counters recorded on the sessions
  themselves, so it covers the report period rather than a trailing window ending at
  report generation time, which is what `opencode stats` still reports. Every model turn
  in the period is counted, including turns that emitted only internal reasoning; their
  tokens are carried by the neighbouring recorded activity, which is also the table's one
  imprecision — a turn on the period boundary can be counted on the other side of it.
- Report Claude Code verification commands without claiming an outcome. Claude Code tool
  results carry no exit code, so a command whose stderr was empty is recorded as `Ran
  verification command: <command>` at MEDIUM confidence with an unknown status, and
  appears under "In Progress" rather than "Completed". A command that redirects or
  discards its stderr (`2>`, `&>`, `|&`) produces no outcome at all, because its empty
  stderr is an artefact of the redirection. "Verification passed" remains reserved for the
  OpenCode path, which observes a real exit code.
- Stop treating non-empty stderr as a failed command on the Claude Code path. Git writes
  to stderr on success, so the rule produced 31 items of `git stash` and `cd … && uv sync`
  noise against real transcripts — none of which any report section renders, while all of
  them travelled in the outbound LLM request. Only an observed exit code now records a
  failure, which keeps the LLM and `--no-llm` reports describing the same set of problems.
- Cap every evidence item's text at 300 characters for both harnesses, marking the cut
  with an ellipsis. A Claude Code `input.command` is retained whole, so a heredoc used to
  write a file previously carried that file's entire body into the report and into
  optional LLM requests; secret-pattern redaction cannot detect such text.
- Group a Claude Code session that spans several working directories under the last
  one, and read subagent transcripts alongside root sessions, excluded by `--root-only`
  like OpenCode child sessions.
- Warn when a root session records assistant work but no user messages. A Claude Code
  transcript written before roughly version 2.1.187 does not mark human prompts, so such
  a session contributes no goals; the warning replaces a silent loss. Subagent sessions
  are exempt, because a subagent is spawned with its parent's prompt and holds no human
  prompt by design.
- Skip models whose usage totals are all zero in the Claude Code usage table, so the
  `<synthetic>` placeholder Claude Code writes for local and error turns no longer adds
  an all-zero row.
- Honor `AGENT_WORKLOG_HARNESSES__*__ENABLED`. Selecting a disabled harness now fails
  with a configuration error (exit code 3) instead of the setting being ignored.
- Move the shared subprocess runner out of the OpenCode package into
  `agent_worklog.process.CommandRunner` so both harnesses depend on one implementation.

## 0.3.0

- Add a transient, single-line progress status to `scan` and `report`, showing the
  current stage and accurate session or repository counts during long operations.
- Keep progress on stderr so `report --dry-run` stdout remains valid Markdown, and
  suppress progress completely with `--quiet`.
- Keep progress labels generic to avoid exposing session, path, repository, warning,
  or API details; clip long statuses to one row on narrow terminals.

## 0.2.0

- Re-release 0.1.1 under a correct semantic version. That release added features, so it
  belongs in a minor version. The contents are otherwise unchanged; prefer 0.2.0.

## 0.1.1

- Add a Traditional Chinese README and a status badge row, and declare MIT and
  Python 3.11–3.13 classifiers so the PyPI project page reports them.
- Add `--root-only` to `scan` and `report` to exclude child and subagent sessions. Child
  sessions remain included by default and stay attributed to the repository they ran in.
- List each repository's session titles, session IDs, and working directories in the report.
  Session identifiers are always derived from recorded evidence, never from an LLM response.
- Add a `## Usage` report section from `opencode stats`. The window runs from the report
  period's start to generation time, because OpenCode reports usage only for a window ending
  now; the report states this. An unavailable `opencode stats` becomes a warning, not a
  failed report.
- Translate subprocess timeouts and launch failures inside the command runner, so a hung
  `opencode` or `git` call degrades to a failed check or a fallback identity instead of an
  unhandled traceback.
- Read the clock once per `report` invocation, so `--days N` no longer reports an N+1 day
  usage window. An invalid timezone is now reported before invalid period selectors.

## 0.1.0

- Add an installable Python 3.11+ CLI with `doctor`, `scan`, and `report` commands.
- Query OpenCode sessions across all projects through the OpenCode CLI.
- Select sessions by interval overlap and filter exact half-open activity ranges.
- Export transcripts with `--sanitize` and tolerate individual export failures.
- Normalize Git remotes and group sessions from multiple worktrees by repository.
- Preserve repository ownership for parent and child sessions.
- Extract provenance-aware evidence and recursively redact common secrets.
- Generate secure deterministic Markdown reports.
- Add optional OpenAI-compatible structured summaries with retry and fallback.
- Add Python 3.11–3.13 CI and trusted-publishing release automation.
